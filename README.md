# GH.3: Making The Initial Commmit To A New GitHub Repository

Create a new repository, clone it, add code, and push.

After accepting this assignment (you did or you wouldn't be here), you will have a new repository on GitHub. This repository will also be linked to [GitHub Classroom][classroom] where I can see it.

[classroom]: #

Here is what to do:

1. On GitHub, click on the green **Clone or download** button and copy the URL of the repository.
1. On your computer, launch **Git Bash**.
1. Change directories to the folder that holds your Unity projects:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/the/folder/holding/your/Pong/project
   ```
